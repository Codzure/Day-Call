# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AudioManager class in the DayCall Android application currently has several issues that need to be addressed to improve code quality, functionality, and maintainability. This includes duplicate methods, missing error handling improvements, and potential enhancements to the audio management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AudioManager to have clean, non-duplicated code, so that the codebase is maintainable and free of compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AudioManager class is compiled THEN there SHALL be no duplicate method signatures
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all methods SHALL have unique names and purposes
3. IF there are similar functionalities THEN they SHALL be consolidated into single, well-designed methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper volume control functionality, so that users can adjust audio levels consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user increases volume THEN the system SHALL increment volume by a consistent amount
2. WHEN a user decreases volume THEN the system SHALL decrement volume by a consistent amount
3. WHEN volume reaches maximum (1.0f) THEN further increases SHALL be ignored
4. WHEN volume reaches minimum (0.0f) THEN further decreases SHALL be ignored
5. WHEN volume is changed THEN the new volume SHALL be applied to any currently playing audio

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and logging, so that audio issues can be diagnosed and resolved more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio operations fail THEN the system SHALL log meaningful error messages
2. WHEN fallback audio fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
3. WHEN invalid audio files are requested THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback
4. WHEN MediaPlayer operations fail THEN resources SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent state management, so that the audio system's state is always accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio starts playing THEN the isPlaying state SHALL be updated immediately
2. WHEN audio stops playing THEN the isPlaying state SHALL be updated immediately
3. WHEN preview audio starts THEN the isPreviewPlaying state SHALL be updated immediately
4. WHEN preview audio stops THEN the isPreviewPlaying state SHALL be updated immediately
5. WHEN MediaPlayer is released THEN all associated state SHALL be reset

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper resource management, so that the application doesn't leak memory or hold unnecessary resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MediaPlayer instances are no longer needed THEN they SHALL be properly released
2. WHEN the AudioManager is destroyed THEN all MediaPlayer resources SHALL be cleaned up
3. WHEN switching between audio files THEN previous MediaPlayer instances SHALL be released before creating new ones
4. WHEN coroutines are launched THEN they SHALL be properly scoped to avoid memory leaks
